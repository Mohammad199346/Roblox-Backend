# Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a virtual factory in Roblox. In the first step we have implemented a scenario where objects (like transporters) of our virtual factory can be controlled from an external application. We have implemented this scenario by going through the following steps:
1. Datastore: We have used the feature of Datastore present in Roblox. We are using Datastore to store objects' locations in it. 
2. Open Cloud DataStore API: Now once we have objects' locations data inside datastore, we can access and modify it using Open Cloud DataStore API.
3. App Connectivity: We have then connected an external application by using the endpoint provided by the Open Cloud DataStore API.
